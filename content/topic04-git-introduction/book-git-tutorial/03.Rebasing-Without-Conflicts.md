# Git rebasing

Push the changes by typing `git push <remote> <branch>`, If the branch isn’t out of date, then the changes will push straight up to your github repo, If it is out of date however, you will have to rebase.

## What is rebasing?
If someone commits a change and your branch is behind, "git rebase" will fast forward your branch to include your changes 

### If you do have to rebase, you will be presented with 3 options :
```sh
git rebase --continue
git rebase --skip
git rebase --abort
```

`git rebase --continue` : used when there are no conflicts or the conflicts are solved.  

`git rebase --skip` : skips the file and won't be involved in the rebase.  

`git rebase --abort` : kills the process completely, allowing you to start again.  

## The process of rebasing
Before you start rebasing, you want to make sure that your local branch is up to date with the remote master branch.  You can do this by git pulling any updates from the remote to your local master branch. If nothing happened that means that your branch was already up to date.
```sh
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```
Once the parent branch is updated, you switch back to the `<branch>` and start the rebase.
```sh
git checkout <branch>
git rebase master
```
You will be presented with the 3 options that were mentioned before.  

If there are no conflicts found, then you will be able to continue the rebase and push your changes.
```sh
git rebase --continue
git push <remote> <branch>
```
