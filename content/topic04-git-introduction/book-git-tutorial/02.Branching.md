# Git Branching

## What is Branching?

This document is to show how branching works in git and how to use it. Branching is a feature available in git that lets you pull off from the master branch to make changes that won't directly effect the master branch unless merged. It also means that others have to review your work first just in case you have errors in your work such as spelling or bugs.

## Why Would You Use Branching?

The main reason using different branches is so that you are not pushing to master. We don't want to push anything to master directly to not affect it especially if you're experimenting or doing something big enough that would cause disruption on the master branch. The created branch would be a safe space for someone to experiment in and do major changes without disrupting the main branch.

## Creating a Branch.
Creating a branch is necessary if we want to make a push to the repo that you forked and are working on. Before we create a new branch we need to make sure we’re in the master branch. To switch between branches we use `git checkout <your-branch-name>`. To create a branch we use the command `git checkout -b <name your branch>` this should now create a new branch in the forked repo.

## Some Other Commands May Include:

```git branch -d <branch-name>```

Deletes the branch that you specify, but won't let you delete it if you have unmerged changes.

```git branch -D <branch-name>```

This will delete the branch regardless of whether you have unmerged changes or not.

```git branch -a```

Lists all the remote branches

```git branch -m <branch>```

Renames the branch to `<branch>`
