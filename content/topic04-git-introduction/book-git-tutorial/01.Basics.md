# Git guide


This manual contains necessary commands for git when working on your own, contributing to other projects and working as a team.


## What is git about?


Git is a version control system that allows you to manage your code easily while working as a team or contributing to other repostories(repo). It allows you to merge code without having to copy and paste it from another file or files. On Github you can also host your website but it does not give you a proper full domain.

## The basics:

```
Git push
Git pull
Git add (filename)
Git status
Git commit -m “first commit”
```

- These commands are used to add files to your repository through a terminal or git bash.
- `git pull`, fetches changes from the remote master and merges changes, it can also be used like this `git pull <remote> <branchname>` to pull down from a remote master or other branch for example like a forked repo.
- To add files from your machine through a terminal or git bash we first use the command `git add <filename>`. Git add basically allows the terminal or git bash to grab your file off your machine and allows it to be committed and pushed to a github repo.


- Before we use `git commit` we use `git status` to see if the file got staged before commiting the file.
Then we use `git commit -m “insert your own message based on the commit”` to commit the file, to see if the file got committed we use `git log` to see if it's committed. If it succesfully committed.

After we committed we use `git push` to push the file into the repo.
