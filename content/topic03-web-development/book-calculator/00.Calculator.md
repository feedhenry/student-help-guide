# Designing the Calculator

Before we start creating our calculator, we should create a wireframe for our calculator first. 

A wireframe is a layout of your application that shows what you're application would look like and is a critical step in designing any application.
This helps us determine and visualize what the application is supposed to look like and how it is supposed to function.

**What should a calculator look like? What should it be able to do?**

The calculator wireframe below shows us where the buttons and input/display should be within our calculator and their functions.
