## Pushing Local Files to a Remote Repository

Now that we have set up our folder to be able to push the local files to the remote github project it is now much simpler to push the rest of the files. Follow the below steps to get your other files up there.

**NOTE**: Make sure that you are in your My-First-Website folder and NOT any other folder on your computer when you do these commands

- Type `ls` and press enter to see what files are in your folder
- Type `git add <filename>` for each of the files that you want to add i.e. for your index.html file type `git add index.html`
- See your files by typing `git status`
  - Any files in green are ready to be committed. Any files in red have not been added yet. If there are files in red that you want to add run the `git add <filename>1 for those files also.
  - Once all the files that you want to add are green then carry on.
- To commit the files run `git commit -m 'adding more files'`.
  - The `-m` indicates the message we want to include with the commit.
- Run `git status`. There should be no more files in green. This means that they are now in the commit.
- Run `git push`
  - This will push the files up to github.
- Once you have (at least) an index file in the github repo you can go to your website in your browser.
- The address should be: `<github-username>.github.io/index.html`
