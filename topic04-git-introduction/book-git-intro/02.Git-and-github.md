# Git and Github.com

# What is Git?

Git is a program used to manage source code. Source code are the files and folders that make up your website (i.e. everything inside your My-First-Website folder)

The image below shows how the local repository (your folder with your website code) and the remote repository (your project on github) relate to each other.

# Creating a repository (project) on Github
In order to set up the remote repository (project) on github we created an account on [Github](https://github.com/).

In order for the website to be hosted we created a New Repository (Project) and named it using the following syntax `<username>.github.io`

This step is essential for the hosting to work. Once the repository is created on github we can go back to the terminal to get our files into that repository.

When you create the repository it will give you the option to add a README to the repo. Chose yes at this option.
