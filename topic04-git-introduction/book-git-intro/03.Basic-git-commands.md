# Basic Git Commands

- `git clone <ssh address>`
  - This creates a new folder inside the folder you are in using the same name as the remote repository and containing any code stored in the remote repository.  


- cd into this new folder
  - Open your folder in your text editor and make a change to it. For Example you could change the heading.  


- `git add README.md`
  - The above command tells git to add the ‘README.md’ file to a ‘staging area’ (don’t worry about what this means right now). This tells git that we will ‘commit’ this file at some point.  


- `git commit -m 'first commit'`
  - The above command tells git to create a ‘commit’ (which bundles any files that we added previously together)  


- `git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git`
  - The above command tells the folder where the remote repository (that we previously created) is.
  - What’s important is to use your own username and reponame where it is indicated. So instead of `<username>` put your actual github username instead. And instead of `<reponame>` put the name of your repository instead.
  - **NOTE**: You may also use an ssh address if you have SSH keys set up.  


- `git push -u origin master`
  - The above command tells git to push any commits we have created to the repository. The first time you do this you will be asked to sign in to github.
  - Once this command is complete go to github and see the files in your project. You should see a README.md file there.
