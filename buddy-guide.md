# Buddy Guide

As part of the onboarding process, each new student will be allocated a buddy. A buddy is typically an experienced team member who will be
able to provide training, instruction and leadership for the new student in the crucial first number of weeks. As such, we need to provide
a guide for what we expect of you as a buddy to help the initial days of the new students setup. This guide will not cover HOW to train
someone, we will leave that in your expert hands, it is designed to ensure the smooth and fast ramp up of the new student.


# Before the new student starts

* Ensure you are familiar with who your new student will be. Read their CV, learn something about them
* Ensure you have the new students account details ready
* Ensure there is space and hardware available for them
* Create a permanent Bluejeans room that you can share with your buddy for the duration of your training together
* Reach out to specialists to schedule complementary training for Week 1

# Day 1

* Find out a little about them personally, you are going to work closely over the next month
* Share with them your email, Slack and IRC handles, ensure the communication lines are always open
* Add them to the rh-students Slack channel for peer support
* Assist them with setting up a GitHub account, and add them to any relevant organisations if appropriate
* Show them the new student section in `feedhenry/student-help-guide`
* Help them navigate around Gmail, recommend that they setup some filters especially for our github projects

# Week 1

* Introduce the buddy to the wider team, be it through IRC, Slack, Email, Bluejeans or all of the above
* If it is an on site student, walk them around and introduce them to the wider Red Hat community
* Make them aware of the various FeedHenry and open-source channels and lists



# End of Week 1
* Hold a 30 minute retrospective

A 1:1 retrospective with your new student will allow us to see if there are areas in documentation, plans, guides, tools & processes where we can make improvements. Discuss the retrospective around roughly three questions to try and focus it and state clearly that this is about improving the process as per our Agile principles. Honest feedback is what we need and inform your new student that we don't take this personally, it is about us learning as a team. Some sample questions could be:

* With the great benefit of hindsight what would you have liked in place before you started
* If you were the buddy, would you have approached the mentoring differently?
* What aspects of the on boarding did you enjoy and should we put more emphasis on them?
* Were you happy with the level of exposure to the wider RHMAP teams?
* Did you find the documentation useful for troubleshooting?
* Did we get anything wrong which slowed down your progress? How could we have prevented that?
* How did this onboarding compare to previous employers? Can you make any suggestions that you felt worked in the past?

The questions are only a guideline, feel free to use any of our usual retrospective approaches and don't limit the conversation.

* Encourage new students to be pro-active in improving documentation for the next student.

It would be good to add to the docs with a PR early in the process to show them how it works and to ensure our documentation is up to date.

* Encourage new students to give you feedback on how you performed as a buddy, particularly on oversights

This is of the utmost importance as each new student brings a different experience. They might be from a different development background, a different culture, they might be remote or local and might have a different on-boarding to previous remote / local students. It is important to update the buddy guide to tweak our process and help inform future buddies as well as learning as a buddy and trainer.
