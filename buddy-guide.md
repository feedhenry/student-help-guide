# What is a buddy?
As part of Red Hat's internship programme, each student will be allocated a buddy. A buddy is an experienced team member who will be able to provide training, instruction and leadership for the student. The student-buddy system is a two-way relationship. It is up to the buddy and the student how that relationship is built. This is only a guideline which specifies what is expected of you as a buddy or as a student to ensure that both individuals will have a smooth and pleasant experience during the duration of the internship. 

# What is expected of you as a buddy
